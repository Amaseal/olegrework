Himalayan International, established in 2016 and produces unique natural dog chews originating in Himalayan region. Exceptional quality, hand made natural products is the foundation of the company, and is the driving force behind all decisions; whether itâ€™s which materials to purchase or the best way to serve our customers.

The main purpose of the packaging was to introduce the product to a new market in the United Arab Emirates. The task was to highlight the exclusivity and quality of the product. As a result, the targets were met and the product successfully received support and funding for market integration.
