title: About me
description: My name is Oleg Klochanyk I am from Latvia and I have been working
  as a graphic designer for 6 years, mostly creating corporate identities and
  all kind of print work design. Over the years I learned to find a personal
  approach for each client, understand his problem and find solutions both
  visual and technical. Many years of experience with print house gave me
  knowledge of printing technology and its various nuances, so I can prepare
  projects for the print correctly, considering technological features and also
  recommend the best option for clients’ needs. I can create a beautiful visuals
  but I am also a fast layout designer which is critical to meet client’s
  deadlines. My working tools are Adobe illustrator, indesign, photoshop, After
  Effects and I keep learning new tools and skills.
